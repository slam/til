# How to Boot into Safe Mode on Apple Silicon Macs

I needed to boot into safe mode to delete some local Time Machine snapshots that were taking up a lot of disk space but couldn't be deleted in regular mode.

1. Shut down the Mac.
2. Press and hold the power button until startup options appear.
3. Select the boot disk.
4. Hold down the Shift key. The "Continue" button changes to "Continue in Safe Mode".
